# 301-wwyd-translation
Translation of 301 wwyd mahjong book.  
Status: Chapters 3/10 
Status: page 73/220.  
Please report typos or other errors, either in /mjg/ thread or here (better). Seriously, if you want to lend a hand just make a throwaway account and report errors. 

## Translation
Uses https://translateimages.site as a way to get unknown kanji (which in turn uses google vision for the OCR, and microsoft for the translation).  
I try to make sense with the help of https://ichi.moe/ and my mahjong and japanese knowledge.
